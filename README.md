Problem in hand: While agriculture is the most significant sector in rural areas and provides a livelihood for 70 per cent of the worldâ€™s poor, it is also the industry that provides the biggest disconnect between supplier and retailer. Due to this farmers dont get the required amount for their harvest because of the corrupt intermediaries.  

Our Solution: We plan to implement supply chain management of crops on blockchain so that the system becomes transparent and independent of any frauds so that the farmers can get their fair share as they will be directly connected to the end user.
