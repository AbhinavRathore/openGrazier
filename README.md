Problem in hand: While agriculture is the most significant sector in rural areas and provides a livelihood for 70 per cent of the worldâ€™s poor, it is also the industry that provides the biggest disconnect between supplier and retailer. Due to this farmers dont get the required amount for their harvest because of the corrupt intermediaries.  

Our Solution: We plan to implement farming on blockchain so that the system becomes transparent and less fraudulent and farmers will be directly connected to end user.
